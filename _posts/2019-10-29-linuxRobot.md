title: Linux Robot
categories: projects
description: A robot which allowed people to connect to it (in fact to log
into it) over the Internet and write programs for it. The first in a series of
installations/performances in which simple robotic hardware 
is made publicly available. The robot is in a constant state
of "becoming", as different programs are uploaded.
