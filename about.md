### More Information

#### History

- Tinkered with electronics and building stuff from a young age
- Studied electrical engineering
- Worked for many years designing hardware and software
  - Digital Microsystems (Networked CP/M computers)
	- TFS and then TRW (high speed image processing)
	- Wind River Systems (Real-time embedded operating system)
	- Etc.

#### Art

- As a child, my tinkering was never oriented towards practical devices. I was
	more interested in experimenting with parts and concepts. 
- This continued
	when I became a professional engineer: While working on practical consumer
	and industrial projects, I would hear about interesting new components and
	think about what wacky impractical things I could do with them.
- But I didn't know what to do with this interest.
- Shortly after college I stumbled into an SRL show.

	I didn't know what it
	was, but I was changed. I realized that there was a place for my
	interest in technology that didn't involve building practical products.
	I fantasized about doing this sort of art.
- (Google "Survival Research Labs" images for tons more)
- Not knowing how to connect with SRL, but inspired to make art, I bought a
	welder and started making non-mechanized contraptions, mostly 
	seemingly impractical furniture
- A few year later (1994 or so) I met someone who worked with SRL, and she
	told me that I could simply come down to the workshop and start working.

#### Teaching

- Working with SRL put me in contact with artists working with technology 
	who didn't have much tehcnical background, and I found myself teaching how
	to use technology. I discovered that I loved teaching (and was told that I
	wasn't bad at it) and started transitioning to a new career as an educator
