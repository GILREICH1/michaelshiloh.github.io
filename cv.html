				<h3>
					Bio
				</h3>
				<p>
Michael Shiloh (Israel, USA) is an artist, engineer, and educator who creates
electro-mechanical and conceptual pieces that often require audience
participation, such as constructing, programming, or making decisions
regarding robot rights and responsibilities.  Michael likes to incorporate
discarded or salvaged mechanisms in his projects.  Michael has exhibited,
spoken, or taught at the Exploratorium (San Francisco), Imperial College
(London), MIT (Boston), Bloomfield Science Museum (Jerusalem), TsingHua
University (Beijing), many galleries in San Francisco, and at Maker Faires in
San Francisco, New York, Jerusalem, Shenzhen and Chengdu (China) and many
conferences worldwide.  Michael collaborates with machine performance group
Survival Research Labs and with them has performed across the USA as well as
in Tokyo and Amsterdam.  Michael is currently a professor of Interactive Media
at New York University Abu Dhabi, where he teaches students how to work with
electronics, programming, and physical materials to create artwork.  Michael is the co-author, along with Massimo Banzi, of the third
and fourth editions of "Getting Started with Arduino"

				<h3>
Artist Statement
				</h3>
				<h4>
Short form
</h4>
<p>
Michael creates situations in which participants are encouraged to 
explores their relationship to technology by becoming part of the 
artmaking process. Michael uses deconstructed familiar objects and 
materials, and simple construction techniques, encouraging an "I could make
that" attitude. 
</p> 
<h4> Long form
</h4> 
<h4> My art follows these main themes:
</h4> 
<p> 1. I'm disturbed by exclusionary attitudes, such as might be
perceived regarding math or computer programming ("you must be this smart to
understand this"). I like to set up situations which allow/encourage/force
visitors to participate in the creation of the artwork. I consider this a form
of Relational Aesthetics, in the sense that I act more as a facilitator than a
maker, and I regard the art both as the constructed result and as the
information exchanged between the artist and the viewers, and between the
viewers. I consider this work provocative in that it allows unrelated
individuals to participate in a common feeling or event they might not
otherwise experience collectively.  
</p>

<h5>
Examples:
</h5>
<p>

- I set up discarded electrical and electronic devices on tables, along with
tools. I also strung up wires along the walls carrying low voltages.
Visitors disassembled the devices, removed components (e.g. motors, LEDs,
speakers), and connected them to the wires to activate them. I and my
volunteers moved between participants, assisting in identifying usable
components and hooking them up.
- "Robots on the March!" Artists' Television Access, San Francisco, 2005
</p>
<p>

- I made very simple robots and brought a pair of computers to be used to
program them. The unprogrammed robots had no "personality". Visitors sat at
the computers and programmed the robots to give them a personality. I and my
assistants helped explain how to do this, but left the choice of personality
up to the participants. The robots then ran around the gallery until another
visitor picked a robot and changed its personality.
- “Automatic: Robotic Art”, Lowerdeck Gallery, San Francisco, 2009
</p>
<p>

- From 2006 to 2008 I organized and ran a giant workshop at the Bay Area Maker
Faire, in which we gathered about 6 tons of discarded electronic,
mechanical, and scrap material, provided tools and consumables such as wire
and batteries, and allowed visitors to take things apart and build whatever
they wanted. While some were highly skilled, the ones that interested me the
most were families who started by identifying the one who would make while
the rest watched. What happened is that the "watchers" soon got involved as
well. This fascinated me because they had overcome their self-identification
as a non-maker. While I didn't situate this as an art project, this clearly
is a form of Relational Aesthetics.
</p>
<h5>
2. Furniture series:
</h5>
<p>
I made a series of furniture from concrete, scrap wood, scrap metal, and
broken glass. The furniture was designed to provoke reactions of fear or
disgust, but in fact was safe and functional. This was an early project
(1990s) and I've not made any since, perhaps because I've not been inspired by
the proper scrap metal or broken glass.
</p>

<h5>
3. Speculative Robotics:
</h5>
<p>
This series once again challenges exclusionary assumptions, this time
specifically addressing the assumption that robotics research can only be
performed by highly trained engineers, in well equipped labs, using very
expensive and complex equipment and components. My robots are designed to be
non-precious, encouraging visitors to modify them, in some cases mechanically,
in others programmatically.
</p>

<h5>
Examples:
</h5>
<p>

- Telepresence Robot (Robonica): A very simple mobile platform, a little less
than human height, with a camera, screen, microphone, and loudspeaker,
running custom video conferencing software. The software allows a remove
viewer to "drive" the robot around, seeing what the robot sees and hearing
what the robot hears, while being projected onto the screen and loud speaker
of the robot. In this way the remote viewer is "projected" into a remote
physical space, allowing interaction with people there. The purpose of this
project is not to develop a telepresence robot, but to encourage participant
and bystanders to make additions or modifications to the robot, to see what
ideas non-roboticists might come up with. The robot is currently broken, but
the goal was to let make it available to anyone on campus to "drive" or
modify.
</p>
<p>

- Robot with No Personality 2 (Man or Machine): Building on the "Robots With
No Personality" project from 2009, this is a human sized robot that has the
ability to express itself in very simple ways: changing the shape of its
mouth and eyes, moving its ears, moving itself, and speaking. The robot
approaches visitors and engages in very simple conversations.  This robot is
paired with a "Personality Creation Station" where other visitors select how
the robot should respond to various situations. Of interest is what sort of
choices visitors make in choosing the robot's responses, and in other
visitors' reactions to the robot's behaviour. This robot is under
development and needs quite a bit of work.
</p>
<p>

<h5>
4. Machine Art: 
</h5>
<p>
For almost 4 decades I've worked with the machine performance
group Survival Research Labs, building machines and putting on performances
with them. Each machine is very large and complex and is a collaborative
effort involving many participants.
</p>
<p>

<h5>
5. Sound Art: 
</h5>
<p>
Combining my interest in experimental music and mechanisms, I
have made a series of sound making machines. I'm interested in making sound in
as unconventional way as possible, so I avoid simple wind, percussion, and
string devices and try to make sound in other ways, such as rolling scrap
metal in a large metal cylinder or bending plastic that creaks when bent.

<h5>
Notes:
</h5>
<p>

- Movement: I like things that move, I like to use motors
</p>
<p>

- Surprising, humorous, delightful, or frightening: I like setting up
	situations in which assumptions are broken
</p>
<p>
- Discarded, surplus, and recycled materials: While the environmental impact
	to this is obvious, my reasons are aesthetic. I am drawn to items that
	others consider worthless. I also derive great pleasure from reusing
	discarded materials.
</p>
<p>
- Audience participation, audience generated
</p>
<p>
- Crossover between Relational Aesthetics and Education: much of my
	interactive work has an educational element, sometimes as a provocation to
	try something new, sometimes as a trick to get the visitor to do something
	that they thought they couldn't. I'm also a full-time professor. These two
	overlap in ways that sometimes makes it even more difficult to propose
	Relational Aesthetics as an art form
</p>
<p>

- Non-precious construction techniques, encouraging viewers to think "I could
	make that". Related to the theme of education.
</p>
<p>
	
- DIY culture, identification (self and by others), inclusion and exclusion
</p>
<p>

- Sharing knowledge, open source, exposing the inner workings
