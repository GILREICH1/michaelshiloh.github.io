Meanwhile, here is a tentative artist bio:
				</p>
				<p>
Michael Shiloh (Israel, USA) is an artist, engineer, and educator who creates
electro-mechanical and conceptual pieces that often require audience
participation, such as constructing, programming, or making decisions
regarding robot rights and responsibilities.  Michael likes to incorporate
discarded or salvaged mechanisms in his projects.  Michael has exhibited,
spoken, or taught at the Exploratorium (San Francisco), Imperial College
(London), MIT (Boston), Bloomfield Science Museum (Jerusalem), TsingHua
University (Beijing), many galleries in San Francisco, and at Maker Faires in
San Francisco, New York, Jerusalem, Shenzhen and Chengdu (China) and many
conferences worldwide.  Michael collaborates with machine performance group
Survival Research Labs and with them has performed across the USA as well as
in Tokyo and Amsterdam.  Michael is currently a professor of Interactive Media
at New York University Abu Dhabi, where he teaches students how to work with
electronics, programming, and physical materials to create artwork.  Michael is the co-author, along with Massimo Banzi, of the third
and fourth editions of "Getting Started with Arduino"
