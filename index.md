I've been an Associate Professor of Practice of Interactive Media at New York
University since the fall of 2017. Before this I was an Associate Professor 
at California College of the Arts and a lecturer at 
University of California, Berkeley

My current research and practice includes:

- Physical computing, including how it is taught, how it is learned, 
and how the pedagogy can be improved
- Attribution of intelligence: How simple systems can exhibit complex
behavior, and how we tend to attribute intelligence to this behavior
- Participant generated behavior: Given a system with the potential to behave,
	what behaviors will participants choose to give it?
- Participant generated physicality: Given a system with potential physical
	abilities,
	what behaviors will participants choose to give it?

Prior areas of research include:

- Conceptual information art
- Conceptual furniture
- Machine art
