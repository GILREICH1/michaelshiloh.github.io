					I teach! I really enjoy teaching and I spend too much time
					inventing new classes, or new projects for existing classes. I keep
					all of my material on <a

				</p>
				<p>
					You are welcome to use any of my teaching materials, 
					but please cite where you got them and include a link

        <h2>Introduction to Interactive Media</h2>

				<p>
					This is the only class I'm teaching that I did not create.  As the
					name suggests it's our basic introductory course to what we call
					Interactive Media. Topics covered include technology (programming in
					p5.js and electronics using Arduino), human centered design, and
					critique of technology. 
        <img src="images/intro2_dec2017_640x320.jpg"
				</p>

				<p>
					Since multiple teachers teach this course, we have a common 
        <a href="https://intro.nyuadim.com/">Wordpress blog</a>
					for the class, but I still keep my own lecture notes and other 
					materials in my own

        <h2>Performing Robots</h2>

				<p>
					We build robots, and make them perform. We 
					learn the necessary technology,
					discuss the ethics of using robots and 
					how robots are perceived on the stage and in public,
					and spend lots of time building, testing, debugging, and refining
					our robots. At the end we put on a public performance.

        <h2>Robota Psyche</h2>
					<img src="images/chinonYeremRobotaPsyche_640x320.png" alt="Image for Robota Psyche">
				<p>
					The only class in which we don't build things. I created this class
					during the COVID-19 pandemic as an alternative to Machine Lab 
					since all teaching was online and the intensive building required
					 by Machine Lab would have been impossible.
				</p>

				<p>
				Robota Psyche was inspired by the book 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle">
				Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology 
				</a>
				by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Braitenberg">
				Valentino Braitenberg
				</a>

				, a neuroscientist and cyberneticist. In this 
				short and very enjoyable book, Braitenberg leads the reader 
				through a series of thought exercises in which he develops vehicles 
				that, with combinations of sensors and actuators, 
				can be said to  exhibit
				behaviors such as aggression, love, foresight, and optimism.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				While Braitenberg's book suggests hardware,
				the process is easily transferable to software, with the great
				advantage that once the code for a vehicle is written, it can be easily
				duplicated, allowing for experimentation with large populations of
				vehicles with similar or different "personalities". We can then
				observe how the vehicles interact with each other and their
				surroundings over time.
