			<p>
				I have a passion for building things,
        taking things apart, and using the bits that I find
        to make new things.
        I love experimenting with new ideas, new devices, and new techniques.
				I like using parts in ways for which they were not intended.
				I like setting up situations where people have experiences
				that they may not have otherwise.

				My research interests include
				how people behave around robots, unusual mechanisms,
				and surprising uses of technology.

        My practice includes  participatory art, machine art, experimental
        sound art, and conceptual furniture.
