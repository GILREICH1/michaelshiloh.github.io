        <h2>Introduction to Interactive Media</h2>

				<p>
					This is the only class I'm teaching that I did not create.  As the
					name suggests it's our basic introductory course to what we call
					Interactive Media. Topics covered include technology (programming in
					p5.js and electronics using Arduino), human centered design, and
					critique of technology.

				<p>
					Since multiple teachers teach this course, we have a common 
        <a href="https://intro.nyuadim.com/">Wordpress blog</a>
					for the class, but I still keep my own lecture notes and other 
					materials in my own
        <a href="https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia">Github repository</a>

				<p>
					We build robots, and make them perform. We 
					learn the necessary technology,
					discuss the ethics of using robots and 
					how robots are perceived on the stage and in public,
					and spend lots of time building, testing, debugging, and refining
					our robots. At the end we put on a public performance.

        <h2>Robota Psyche</h2>
					<img src="images/chinonYeremRobotaPsyche_640x320.png" alt="Image for Robota Psyche">
				<p>
					The only class in which we don't build things. I created this class
					during the COVID-19 pandemic as an alternative to Machine Lab 
					since all teaching was online and the intensive building required
					 by Machine Lab would have been impossible.
				</p>

				<p>
				Robota Psyche was inspired by the book 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle">
				<i>Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology</i>
				</a>
				by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Braitenberg">
				Valentino Braitenberg
				</a>

				, a neuroscientist and cyberneticist. In this 
				short and very enjoyable book, Braitenberg leads the reader 
				through a series of thought exercises in which he develops vehicles 
				that, with combinations of sensors and actuators, 
				can be said to  exhibit
				behaviors such as aggression, love, foresight, and optimism.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				While Braitenberg's book suggests hardware,
				the process is easily transferable to software, with the great
				advantage that once the code for a vehicle is written, it can be easily
				duplicated, allowing for experimentation with large populations of
				vehicles with similar or different "personalities". We can then
				observe how the vehicles interact with each other and their
				surroundings over time.

        <h2>Interactive Media in the World Robots</h2>
        <img src="images/performingRobots2022ClassPicture_640x320.jpg"

				<p>
					Interactive Media spans a large range of activities including but
					certainly
					not limited to website design and smartphone app development;
					product design; new interfaces for musical expression; exhibit
					design for museums and other institutions; kinetic art; interactive
					art; immersive art; virtual and augmented reality; robotics;
					and
					education. 
					These activities could take place in individual or
					collaborative artist studios,
					classrooms, design companies, maker spaces, high tech startups,
					libraries, and a host of other places.
					</p>

				<p>
					While teaching in the San Francisco Bay Area I had access
					to a great many spaces and practitioners, and could easily show
					students examples of the kind of activities in which the could
					utilize what we were teaching.

					Here in Abu Dhabi either there isn't such a diversity of activities,
					or I've not found it. Fortunately, not far away in Israel, I have
					similar access to these spaces through family, friends, colleagues,
					and collaborators. 
					</p>

				<p>
					NYU has a framework in which faculty can propose classes
					to take place in other countries. In my course 
					<i>Interactive Media In The World</i>
					we visit artist studios, design studios, Burning Man style maker
					spaces, high tech maker spaces, exhibit designers, special effects
					designers, museums, and other creative spaces. We also collaborate
					with students in related classes and engage in a joint project.
