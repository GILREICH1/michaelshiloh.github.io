				<p>
				I have a passion for building things, and learning how to build
				things. I like taking stuff apart and using the bits that I find.
				I love experimenting with new ideas, new devices, and new techniques.
				I like teaching students how to make stuff.  </p>

				<p>
				My research interests include creating environments in which people
				who consider themselves not good at making try making, participatory
				installations, discovering and developing interesting mechanisms, and
				taking things apart.

				I received my BSc in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from
				the University of California at Berkeley. My professional experience
				includes computer hardware, firmware, and designing embedded systems.
				I'm a strong advocate for Open Source, encouraging collaboration and
				sharing of information.  </p>

				I am currently an Associate Professor of Practice of Interactive Media
				at New York University Abu Dhabi.  My subjects include electronics,
				programming, mechatronics, robotics, design, critique of technology
				and experimental interfaces.  Prior to NYU Abu Dhabi I was an
				Associate Professor of Critical Studies at the California College of
				the Arts. You can find my full CV here.
