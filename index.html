				<p>
				I have a passion for building things, 
				taking things apart, and using the bits that I find
				to make new things.
				I love experimenting with new ideas, new devices, and new techniques.
				I like using parts in ways for which they were not intended.
				I like setting up situations where people have experiences
				that they may not have otherwise.
				</p>

				<p>
				My research interests include
				how people behave around robots, unusual mechanisms, 
				and surprising uses of technology.
				</p>


				<p>
				My practice includes  participatory art, machine art, experimental
				sound art, and conceptual furniture.
				</p>


				<p>
				I received my BSc in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from
				the University of California at Berkeley. My professional experience
				includes computer hardware, firmware, and designing embedded systems.
				I'm a strong advocate for Open Source, encouraging collaboration and
				sharing of information.  </p>

				<p>
				Working with art started when I was young, tinkering with electronics.
				I wasn't interested in practical devices. I wanted to make
				devices that were surprising or caused a sense of joy or
				wonder. I learned to weld and work with machines in the machine shop
				of a Kibbutz and further developed my metalworking skills and my
				artistic style in the San
				Francisco Bay Area machine art scene, particularly with Survival
				Research Labs, with whom I've worked since 1994. My conceptual
				furniture series started in 1991.
				</p>

				<p>
				I am currently an Associate Professor of Practice of Interactive Media
				at New York University Abu Dhabi.  I teach electronics,
				programming, mechatronics, robotics, design, critique of technology,
				and experimental interfaces.  Prior to NYU Abu Dhabi I was an
				Associate Professor of Critical Studies at the California College of
				the Arts. You can find my full CV here.
