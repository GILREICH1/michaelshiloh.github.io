        <h2>Welcome to this simple styled website</h2>
        <p>I have a passion for building things, and learning how to build things. My techniques include taking stuff apart and experimenting with new ideas, new devices, and new techniques. My teaching style includes much making.

My research interests include creating environments in which people who consider themselves not good at making try making, participatory installations, discovering and developing interesting mechanisms, and taking things apart.
