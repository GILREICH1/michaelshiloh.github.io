				<h2>
					Relational Aesthetics and Participatory Art
				</h2>
				<p>
				  In this category of my projects, the work displayed must be
					understood not as objects but as sites of interaction. 
				  <i>Relational Aesthetics</i> is a phrase coined by 
					Nicolas Bourriaud in his book <i>Relational Aesthetics</i> (1998).
					Bourriaud asserts that the interpersonal relationships that develop
					in the context of these projects have formal qualities, and it is
					these formal qualities that can give such a work of art its value. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For reasons discussed later, I use discarded electronic devices as
					my raw material, setting up situations in which visitors, now
					participants, disassemble these devices, and, optionally, can use
					the salvaged parts to create new devices. Visitors will often claim
					that they don't know how to do this, but after awhile, with very
					little, or sometimes no prompting, will timidly pick up the tools
					and get started. Once they start, they often stay for much longer
					than they expected. Participants describe getting completely
					absorbed and becoming focused on the task at hand that they lose
					track of time.  Participants who don't know each other find
					themselves talking with and collaborating with other participants.
					Taking things apart is a puzzle of sorts: trying to find the right
					order of fasteners to be removed to free a part. Participants become
					intrigued by the parts revealed, wondering what they are and what
					role they played in the device.  These experiences, conversations,
					questions, and discoveries are the elements that make up the formal
					qualities of the work.

				The printers, tools, and participants constitute a system, as used in
				the term system art. In such a system, participants (you) consume
				resources (the printers) and create new forms (sculptures, be they
				static or kinetic). Similarly, the invitation to include your own
				correspondences, and your experience in doing so, blurs the line
				between curator and viewer, questioning who gets to decide how our
				lives and relationships are documented. The individual and communal
				experiences of the participants, and the process that takes place
				during the duration of the installation, are the art, more than the
				resultant sculptures. The pairing of this system art with a gathering
				of correspondences is an invitation to consider how we communicate
				with one another, how this changes as technology develops, and how
				these changes impact our relationships. This installation also creates
				a social interstice, as described by Indrani Saha: “Drawn on Marxian
				language and repurposed by Nicolas Bourriaud in his text, Relational
				Aesthetics, the term social interstices refers to a space that
				facilitates human social interaction. Marx refers to the term
				interstice as a pocket of trading activity that stands outside the
				capitalist framework. Similarly, social interstice as Bourriaud uses
				it references a similar defiance of the dominant system. In this case,
				social interstices are those spaces of free interaction that provide
				opportunities for social engagement outside of the norm.” In this
				social interstice we question replacement vs. repair or reuse, and who
				has agency to repair, to reuse, to archive, or to create art.


How is permission given to open an appliance or to create art? Exclusion comes
from others as well as ourselves, as we identify or are identified in
different ways (“I’m not good at math”, “Girls don’t build”, “ you’re not a
real artist”). What identities do we adopt? What identities are thrust upon
us?

Why take things apart? Taking things apart is fun, it’s messy, it’s a way of
interacting with devices in ways we usually don’t. It engages a part of our
brain and body in ways that we usually don’t. Appliances are usually treated
as mysterious “black boxes”, the inner workings of which are a secret, known
only to a select cabal of initiates. Did we consciously choose to be ignorant?
Taking things apart can give us insight into what’s inside and how they are
held together.  —------
