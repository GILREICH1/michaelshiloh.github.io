					Relational Aesthetics and Participatory Art
				</h2>
				<p>
				The printers, tools, and participants constitute a system, as used in the term system art. In such a system, participants (you) consume resources (the printers) and create new forms (sculptures, be they static or kinetic). Similarly, the invitation to include your own correspondences, and your experience in doing so, blurs the line between curator and viewer, questioning who gets to decide how our lives and relationships are documented. The individual and communal experiences of the participants, and the process that takes place during the duration of the installation, are the art, more than the resultant sculptures. The pairing of this system art with a gathering of correspondences is an invitation to consider how we communicate with one another, how this changes as technology develops, and how these changes impact our relationships. This installation also creates a social interstice, as described by Indrani Saha: “Drawn on Marxian language and repurposed by Nicolas Bourriaud in his text, Relational Aesthetics, the term social interstices refers to a space that facilitates human social interaction. Marx refers to the term interstice as a pocket of trading activity that stands outside the capitalist framework. Similarly, social interstice as Bourriaud uses it references a similar defiance of the dominant system. In this case, social interstices are those spaces of free interaction that provide opportunities for social engagement outside of the norm.” In this social interstice we question replacement vs. repair or reuse, and who has agency to repair, to reuse, to archive, or to create art.

What is the future equivalent of going up to the attic and reading your grandmother’s letters?

How do different modes of communication affect the depth of the conversation? How does this help or hinder maintaining relationships?

How do you tell someone of the death of a loved one? How would you want to be told? Do you have an internal criteria for deciding what mode of communication to use?

How are our lives and relationships preserved in our communications?

Cards:

Why doesn’t it look clean and finished? The construction techniques used in this installation are intentionally low fidelity, as a gesture towards inclusivity. You can reuse parts from an appliance even if you are not a “qualified technician”, you can create art even if you don’t possess excellent woodworking skills or expensive equipment.

How is permission given to open an appliance or to create art? Exclusion comes from others as well as ourselves, as we identify or are identified in different ways (“I’m not good at math”, “Girls don’t build”, “ you’re not a real artist”). What identities do we adopt? What identities are thrust upon us?

Why take things apart? Taking things apart is fun, it’s messy, it’s a way of interacting with devices in ways we usually don’t. It engages a part of our brain and body in ways that we usually don’t. Appliances are usually treated as mysterious “black boxes”, the inner workings of which are a secret, known only to a select cabal of initiates. Did we consciously choose to be ignorant? Taking things apart can give us insight into what’s inside and how they are held together.
