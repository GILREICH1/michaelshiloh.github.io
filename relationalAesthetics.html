				<h2>
					Relational Aesthetics and Participatory Art
				</h2>
				<p>
				  In this category of my projects, the work displayed must be
					understood not as objects but as sites of interaction. 
				  <i>Relational Aesthetics</i> is a phrase coined by 
					Nicolas Bourriaud in his book <i>Relational Aesthetics</i> (1998).
					Bourriaud asserts that the interpersonal relationships that develop
					in the context of these projects have formal qualities, and it is
					these formal qualities that can give such a work of art its value. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For reasons discussed later, I use discarded electronic devices as
					my raw material, setting up situations in which visitors, now
					participants, disassemble these devices, and, optionally, can use
					the salvaged parts to create new devices. Visitors will often claim
					that they don't know how to do this, but after awhile, with very
					little, or sometimes no prompting, will timidly pick up the tools
					and get started. Once they start, they often stay for much longer
					than they expected. They describe getting completely
					absorbed and becoming focused on the task at hand that they lose
					track of time.  Strangers find
					themselves talking with and collaborating with each other.
					Taking things apart is a puzzle of sorts: trying to find the right
					order of fasteners to be removed to free a part. Participants become
					intrigued by the parts revealed, wondering what they are and what
					role they played in the device.  These experiences, conversations,
					questions, and discoveries are the elements that make up the formal
					qualities of the work.  
				</p>

				<p>
				  The use of discarded machinery is a subtle critique of our appetite
					for increasingly sophisticated technologies at low prices.
					Manufacturing costs are reduced by removing features allowing
					maintenance and repair, resulting in a high rate of replacement.
					As the vehicle for creating my artwork, the discarded machinery is
					proven not useless.
				</p>

				"... Bourriaud identifies
				political significance in these relationships as models of interaction
				that critically reflect upon wider society. Bourriaud argues that by
				setting up real interactive situations in the gallery, relational
				works of art do not ‘represent utopias’ but actualise them, creating
				positive ‘life possibilities’ as ‘concrete spaces’ rather than merely
				fictional ones." (Mark Windsor, Art of Interaction: A Theoretical
				Examination of Carsten Höller’s Test Site,
				https://www.tate.org.uk/research/tate-papers/15/art-of-interaction-a-theoretical-examination-of-carsten-holler-test-site)
				</p>

				<p>
				“Drawn on Marxian
				language and repurposed by Nicolas Bourriaud in his text Relational
				Aesthetics, the term social interstices refers to a space that
				facilitates human social interaction. Marx refers to the term
				interstice as a pocket of trading activity that stands outside the
				capitalist framework. Similarly, social interstice as Bourriaud uses
				it references a similar defiance of the dominant system. In this case,
				social interstices are those spaces of free interaction that provide
				opportunities for social engagement outside of the norm.” 
				(Social Interstices, Indrani Saha,
				https://mjsymuleski.com/artofthemooc/social-interstices/)
				</p>

				</p>
				How is permission given to open an appliance or to create art?
				Exclusion is implicit in how we identify ourselves or are identified
				by others ("I'm not good with tools", “I’m not good at math”, “Girls
				don’t build”, “you’re not a real artist”, etc.). In the 
				social interstice 
				and
				actualized utopia 
				of this work, visitors may challenge these identities.

		- I set up discarded electrical and electronic devices on tables, along with
tools. I also strung up wires along the walls carrying low voltages.
Visitors disassembled the devices, removed components (e.g. motors, LEDs,
speakers), and connected them to the wires to activate them. I and my
volunteers moved between participants, assisting in identifying usable
components and hooking them up.

		I made very simple robots and brought a pair of computers to be used to
		program them. The unprogrammed robots had no "personality". Visitors sat
		at the computers and programmed the robots to give them a personality. I
		and my assistants helped explain how to do this, but left the choice of
		personality up to the participants. The robots then ran around the gallery
		until another visitor picked a robot and changed its personality.  -

				From 2006 to 2008 I organized and ran a giant workshop at the Bay Area
				Maker Faire, in which we gathered about 6 tons of discarded
				electronic, mechanical, and scrap material, provided tools and
				consumables such as wire and batteries, and allowed visitors to take
				things apart and build whatever they wanted. While some were highly
				skilled, the ones that interested me the most were families who
				started by identifying the one who would make while the rest watched.
				What happened is that the "watchers" soon got involved as well. This
				fascinated me because they had overcome their self-identification as a
				non-maker. While I didn't situate this as an art project, this clearly
				is a form of Relational Aesthetics.  </p>
